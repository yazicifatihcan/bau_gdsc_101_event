# BAU GDSC Event Speech Project

**Note: This project is designed for my upcoming speech at the BAU GDSC event. I will be discussing various Flutter development concepts and techniques during the presentation.**

This repository contains a Flutter project created for the BAU GDSC event. In this project, we will cover various aspects of Flutter development, including state management, API calls, UI design, JSON parsing, and component creation.

## Project Overview

### State Management
We use Flutter's built-in `setState` method for basic state management and the popular package `GetX` for more advanced and efficient state management. You can find examples of both approaches in the code.

### API Call to Rick and Morty API
We demonstrate how to make API calls to the Rick and Morty API using Flutter's `http` package. This showcases how to fetch data from a remote source and work with it in your Flutter app.

### Displaying Data on the UI
The fetched data is displayed on the user interface, and we discuss various widgets and techniques for rendering data in Flutter.

### Parsing JSON Values to Flutter Objects
We show how to parse JSON responses from the API into Flutter objects, making it easier to work with the data in a type-safe manner.

### Creating Components from Widgets and Its Logic
We illustrate how to create reusable components by composing widgets and separating their logic. This is essential for maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
